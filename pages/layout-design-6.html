				The use of skis probably began near the end of the last ice age, approximately 10,000 years ago.
				Remnants of the earliest skis discovered by archaeologists, found in a bog in Russia, date back about
				8,000 years, and were made of wood. Skis have also been depicted in cave drawings in Norway and Russia.
				The earliest of these drawings, which clearly depict skiers on two skis and using ski poles, date back
				between 3,500 and 4,000 years. These early skis were made of single pieces of wood, and tended to be
				flat, short, wide, and heavy. Wood skis continued to be made this way well into the 19th century, when
				technological improvements changed the shape of skis, the materials used to make skis, and the fasteners
				used to laminate dissimilar materials.
			</p>

				The first major improvement in the technology of ski construction took place in Norway around 1850.
				According to the International Skiing History Association, the use of a camber, or bow, in the middle of
				the ski enabled the skier to ski more easily. This design also enabled ski makers to create skis that
				were much thinner, narrower, longer, and lighter. This enabled the skier to expend less energy while
				skiing, and also enabled the skier to move faster and maneuver better.
